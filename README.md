This code represents a simple parking system. Users can park cars, release parking spaces, and view parked cars. The total number of parking spaces is entered by the user, and the program displays menu options to interact with the system.

Main functionalities:

1. Car Parking: Users enter the car's license plate number and park it, provided that parking spaces are available.
2. Car Release: Users enter the car's license plate number to release a parking space, provided there is a car parked with that license plate number.
3. View Parked Cars: Displays the license plate numbers of cars parked at the moment.

This code can be used as a basic system for parking management and can be adapted or extended based on the specific project's requirements.
